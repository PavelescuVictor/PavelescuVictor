My personality traits fall into the guidelines of a kind and enthusiastic person putting passion into the projects that I'm working on. As a person I am always seeking new challenges, continuously trying to improve myself and eager to learn new technologies. Currently, I am a graduate of Babes Bolyai University with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, and I aspire to work in a challenging and dynamic environment that allows me to further develop myself working with a strong and dedicated team.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects and learning new web technologies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Typescript, GraphQL, Unit Testing and Automation Testing
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web development projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- âš¡ Fun fact: By analyzing the spectrum of light coming from different astronomical objects such as stars and planets and observing its pattern we can determine the chemical composition of those objects.
